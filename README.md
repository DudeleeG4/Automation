Hello!

Welcome to my github. I have had this repo set to private for years because the data contained within my code was sensitive at the time, however that is no longer the case.
The company that I worked for at the time, UKCloud, has long since gone under and the infrastructure that this code refers to no longer exists. This repo is mainly for my own reference.

Not all of these scripts are to a high standard - this repo contains almost all of my powershell scripts from my time at UKCloud, and I was learning from scratch, so this contains my first ever script (Balance Datastore Cluster.ps1) and most of the ones after. Unfortunately I neglected to extricate a lot of my SQL code from my time at EasyPark, but that would only be a private repo anyway as that company still exists.

Most of my scripts are contained within cse_action & cse_read_only - however I also wrote some nice modules which can be found in <>
