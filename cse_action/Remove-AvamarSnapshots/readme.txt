Remove-AvamarSnapshots.ps1

This script is used to forcibly remove avamar snapshots when the task fails in vCenter. It doesn't always work but it seems to overcome issues with the task timing out.

To run the script, right-click and select "Run with powershell".

You will be presented with a list of Avamar snapshots to remove. Select one or more of these and press OK to remove them.
