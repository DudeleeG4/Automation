Get-VMCBTStatus.ps1

This script is used to retrieve the current CBT status of a VM.
This is VERY useful if you need to find the status and the VM is running, as you can’t access the advanced settings via the GUI when the VM is powered on.

Run the script via PowerCLI and it will prompt for the VM name and vCenter name.
