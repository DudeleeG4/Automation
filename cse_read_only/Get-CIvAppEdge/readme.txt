Get-CIvAppEdge

This script pulls down information about all the vApp Networks in vCloud. Unfortunately I have not yet seen a clear identifier on these object which can tell me whether they are actual edges gateways or just networks.

To run the script, simply right-click > run with powershell. You will need to edit the vCloud endpoint to your desired vCloud.

Problems:
. Slow
. Output is difficult to differentiate between vApp Networks and vApp Edges
